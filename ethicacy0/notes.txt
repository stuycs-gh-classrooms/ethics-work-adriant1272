- contract with private companies to develop this; hard for govt to see inside da machine
	- judges and defendants cannot access this info
	- "in a 2016 case from Wisconsin, a private developer denied an offenderâ€™s request for information about the algorithm that was used to determine his sentence on the ground that it was a trade secret"
	- More generic black box problem; how exactly to define (e.g., is recidivism second arrest in next 5 or 10 years?)

- Generic args for risk assessment tools:
	- Reduce prison population; save money
	- Free of individual bias
	- Reduce recidivism --> judge better understands defendent's rehab needs
